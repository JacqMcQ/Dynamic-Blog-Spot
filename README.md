## Introduction:

When interacting with the API for the Dynamic Blog Spot, you can enter a Username title and content for your blog post submission. Upon submitting the user is redirected to page where all the locally stored blog posts are located. Feel free to also check out the "light" and "dark" mode with the added toggle switch at the top. If youlook at the console you will see the "username, blog-title, and content" stored in an array.
